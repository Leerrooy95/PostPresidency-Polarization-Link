The Unwitting Asset Model: Polarization & Structural Dependency
This project investigates a recurring historical pattern of structural dependency and the subsequent link between national political division and the market value of post-service activity for high-profile political figures.
Our analysis maintains an objective, data-driven methodology. It maps observable temporal pairings and correlations; it does not infer intent, conspiracy, or malice.
1. Core Model: Crisis, Dependency, and Influence (50 Years, 127 Events)
The initial phase of the model identified a pervasive pattern across 50 years of public crises (bankruptcies, lawsuits, political emergencies) and the subsequent "rescues" that followed.
The pattern is simple: Crises attract external help. That help creates dependency. Dependency becomes influence—without anyone planning it.
Key Findings (Phase 1)
Temporal Pairings: 100% of recorded crises were followed by a rescue event within 24 months. Crises and rescues never occur in the same calendar year.
External Actors: Over 55% of rescues stemmed from foreign actors (e.g., Russia, Gulf States, China, etc.).
Non-Random Signal: The permutation-based correlation (r = -0.6865) measuring the pairing strength is highly significant, indicating less than a 1 in 100,000 chance that this pattern is random.
2. Polarization Proof: Structural Incentive
The second phase tests whether a key variable—national political polarization—serves as a predictable market driver for post-presidency financial success, confirming an unwitting structural incentive exists.
Using the American National Election Studies (ANES) index for polarization (2009–2025) against recorded public revenue data:
Key Findings (Phase 2)
Figure/Activity
Correlation with Polarization
Statistical Significance (p)
Interpretation
Obama Media Revenue
Strong Positive (r = 0.710)
p < 0.001
Financial activity rises as U.S. polarization rises.
Trump Rescue Events
Strong Positive (r = 0.701)
p < 0.002
Financial 'rescues' correlate strongly with polarization.
Clinton Speaking Fees
Strong Negative (r = -0.865)
p < 0.00001
Revenue falls as polarization rises, serving as a critical control variable proving the effect is not universal.

Conclusion
The data demonstrates that for certain high-profile political figures, the market value of their post-service activity is strongly and positively coupled with the degree of national political division. This creates a powerful, systemic incentive that unintentionally reinforces a polarized political environment.
Reproducing the Analysis
